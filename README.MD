This is not a complete project

I was learning C# for the first time and experimenting with the
Classes and Objects in C#.

I have made a simple program that shows how Classes work in C#.

This is not a perfect example, but this will work for me :)

I am making this project public just because if anyone is
interested in knowing how classes and objects work in C#, you
can always refer to this source code :)

Thank You!
